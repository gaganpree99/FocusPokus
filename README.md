## Project Summary
**FocusPokus**, the Android application developed as a part of the Mobile Computing project-work, is a minimalistic yet captivating game that aims at inculcating cognitive skills.

FocusPokus appeals to those who enjoy games that are engaging and captivating. The game has objects with complex shapes and colors that vary with time. FocusPokus requires simple actions that enable even a na√Øve user to play easily.

An important characteristic of this game is that it can be played even without an active internet connection, thus making it a standalone application. This game is intended for age 5 and up. The features of this application are:
+ Home page with an attractive and minimalistic design 
+ Using SharedPreferences for storing user choice throughout the application lifecycle  
+ Interesting music choice for engrossing player attention
+ No account creation for the purpose of playing the game (no Internet connection needed)
+ Meaningful onboarding information for the first-time users
+ Keep track of past scores

## Functionality
There has been no change in the functionality from the estimated proposal. All the features of minimum and expected functionality have been implemented successfully. Moreover, we were able to achieve one of the bonus features i.e., implementation of the top scores.
<br />
We are currently working on improving the User interface and User experience of the application.<br /><br />

## UML diagrams

You can render UML diagrams using [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). For example, this will produce a sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

And this will produce a flow chart:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Square Rect] -- Link text --> B((Circle))
A --> C(Round Rect)
B --> D{Rhombus}
C --> D
```
